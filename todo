# to fix

# to add

## top priority (asap)
- finish the webui plugin system
    - make webui addons for each plugin

## medium priority (same week)
- make an 'sdr-pro' version of PCB with a bpf for RPITX and a spot for a usb SDR
    - pcb has been ordered (7/30/25)
- implement SPI flash dumping (https://github.com/stacksmashing/pico-serprog)

## low priority (whenever)
- implement ble right
    - BLE hacking
        - Bluejacking
        - [Bluesnarfing](https://github.com/kimbo/bluesnarfer)
        - ~Sour Apple~ impossible with linux ble stack, i *think*

- implement network connect functions correctly, then implement these tools:
    - https://github.com/vanhoefm/macstealer
    - MITM6 (https://github.com/dirkjanm/mitm6)
    - remote cracking with implementation of PSKracker (https://github.com/andrewjlamarche/PSKracker)

- opensesame

# what's done
- ~CC1101~ ~FM transmission~
- ~RSSI sniffing (e.g. look for a lost device by RSSI)~
- ~EAPHammer~
- ~make keystroke reflection DDR instead of SDR~

# wontfix
- more usb stuff
    - ~hidx stealthlink from hak5 or something like that for reverse shell comms~
        - no, it's way too convoluted and platform dependent that there's just no point in implementing it

- add wifi tools like
    - AP wardriving, using a phone for GPS
        - ~this can be done with the new webui~ no it can't, location can't be over http and certs r annoying
        - maybe sometime later, but definitely not on the roadmap yet
