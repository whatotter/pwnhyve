in chrono. order

# to fix
- the whole subghz plugin
    - that shit is FUCKED

# to add
- add wifi tools like
    - AP wardriving, using a phone for GPS
        - this can be done with the new webui

- implement ble right
    - BLE hacking
        - Bluejacking
        - [Bluesnarfing](https://github.com/kimbo/bluesnarfer)
        - ~Sour Apple~ impossible with linux ble stack, i *think*

- more usb stuff
    - ~hidx stealthlink from hak5 or something like that for reverse shell comms~
        - no, it's way too convoluted and platform dependent that there's just no point in implementing it

- implement network functions correctly, then implement these tools:
    - https://github.com/vanhoefm/macstealer
    - MITM6 (https://github.com/dirkjanm/mitm6)
    - remote cracking with implementation of PSKracker (https://github.com/andrewjlamarche/PSKracker)


- implement SPI flash dumping (https://github.com/stacksmashing/pico-serprog)
- opensesame

# what's done
- ~CC1101~ ~FM transmission~
- ~RSSI sniffing (e.g. look for a lost device by RSSI)~
- ~EAPHammer~
- ~make keystroke reflection DDR instead of SDR~
