haven't finished this yet, probably won't  

feel free to try to do it yourself, rename the folder from `_subghz` to `subghz` to get it working again

main objectives of the plugin
- upload and download .sub files
- jam directly from the webui
- play files from the webui

good luck, please do a pr when done, it really helps
