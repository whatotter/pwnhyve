this is notes mostly for me but u can use this

# GPIO
- **use raw BCM pinouts** - gpiozero uses raw BCM pinouts, and so does FastIO
- gpiozero has 100khz polling rate; FastIO has 2mhz polling rate (tested with `./debug/gzmaxio.py` and `./core/pio/fastio.py`, respectively)

shim IO pinout:
```
pins face this way ->
pins with * are recommended to not be used

# spi
- GPIO8 (phys. pin 24) would be for `spidev0.0` (display)
- GPIO18 (phys. pin 12) would be for `spidev0.1` (CC1101)
- GPIO7 (phys. pin 26) would be for `spidev0.2` (other things)

aka JUST RUN THIS
```
dtc -I dts -O dtb -o 3spi.dtbo ./core/installation/spi-cs-extend.dts
sudo cp 3spi.dtbo /boot/overlays/
echo "dtoverlay=3spi" >> /boot/config.txt

sudo reboot
```

                     ||    \\
                     ||     PIL.Image
                     ||
                 DisplayDriver (e.g. ./core/screens/sh1106.py)
                     ||
               DisplayDriver.gui
                     \\
                      BasePwnhyveScreen (e.g. ./addons/menus/flipper.py)
```
